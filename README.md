# Python Data Structures

This repository contains Python examples and starter code for learning key data structures and concepts. The project covers lists, stacks, queues, sets, sequences (tuples, lists, and strings), and dictionaries. Each file contains well-structured code examples, and "TODO" items are included for students to further practice and expand their knowledge.

## Project Structure

```
python-data-structures/
├── data_structures.py  # Lists, Stacks, and Queues
├── sets.py             # Sets and Set Operations
├── sequences.py        # Sequences (Tuples, Lists, Strings)
└── dictionaries.py     # Dictionaries (Key-Value Pairs)
```

Each file contains a specific focus, and examples are explained in a simple and digestible format. The code is designed for beginners or those looking to strengthen their understanding of Python data structures.

## Concepts Covered

### 1. Lists, Stacks, and Queues (in `data_structures.py`)
- Lists: Basic operations, adding/removing elements.
- Stacks: Using Python lists for LIFO structure.
- Queues: Using `deque` for FIFO structure.

### 2. Sets (in `sets.py`)
- Defining and working with sets.
- Set operations: Union, intersection, difference.
- Adding and removing elements from a set.

### 3. Sequences (in `sequences.py`)
- Tuples: Immutable sequences.
- Lists: Mutable sequences.
- Strings: Working with strings and string slicing.

### 4. Dictionaries (in `dictionaries.py`)
- Creating dictionaries with key-value pairs.
- Accessing, updating, and deleting values in dictionaries.
- Merging dictionaries and handling dictionary operations.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Moringa-SDF-PTO7/p03-lecture2-starter.git
   cd python-data-structures
   ```

2. Install Python 3 if you haven't already. You can check your installation with:

   ```bash
   python --version
   ```

3. Explore the code inside each Python file and try running it:

   ```bash
   python data_structures.py
   python sets.py
   python sequences.py
   python dictionaries.py
   ```

## How to Use

Feel free to explore each file. Each example is meant to demonstrate a key Python concept or data structure. The "TODO" comments are prompts for you to extend the examples and solidify your understanding.

## TODO Items

Each file contains "TODO" sections that encourage further exploration, such as:
- Implementing priority queues using Python's `heapq`.
- Writing more set operations like symmetric differences and checking for disjoint sets.
- Writing functions to manipulate sequences using slicing.
- Merging dictionaries and solving real-world dictionary problems.

## Contributing

Contributions to this repository are welcome! If you want to improve the examples or add new topics, feel free to submit a pull request.

1. Fork the repository.
2. Create a new branch (`git checkout -b feature-branch`).
3. Commit your changes (`git commit -m 'Add new feature'`).
4. Push to the branch (`git push origin feature-branch`).
5. Open a pull request.
